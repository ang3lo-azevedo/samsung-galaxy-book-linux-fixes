# Issue #93 — "Speaker fix: woofers produce no bass (tweeters work, sound very thin)" (@Elias02345)

**Classification: real bug in this repo — NOT the known "Linux sounds thinner than
Windows" limitation. Do not close as expected behaviour.**

Hardware: Galaxy Book5 Pro 360, NP960QHA-KG2DE (Lunar Lake), Arch/Omarchy,
kernel 7.1.8-arch1-3, ALC298 + 4x MAX98390 (0x38/0x39 woofers, 0x3c/0x3d
tweeters) — squarely inside `speaker-fix/`'s coverage, not `speaker-fix-940xfg/`.

**Round 1 hypothesis was WRONG — see [Round 2](#round-2--the-blob-fix-changed-nothing) below.**
The blob corruption was real and worth fixing on its own merits, but it is not
what silences the woofers on this machine.

**Status:** fix committed as
[`1194a83`](https://github.com/Andycodeman/samsung-galaxy-book-linux-fixes/commit/1194a83);
reply **posted** 2026-08-25 with maintainer sign-off —

Issue deliberately left **open** pending the reporter's confirmation. Release to
be cut once they confirm.

## Why this is not a duplicate of the documented limitation

The maintainer's initial read was that this is the recurring "thin sound"
report already answered by
[`speaker-fix/README.md#sound-quality--eq`](../../speaker-fix/README.md#sound-quality--eq).
That section does exist, is complete, and has a working anchor — so the close
would have been *linkable*. It is still the wrong call, for one reason:

> "Boosting bass in EasyEffects (PipeWire-side EQ) has **zero** effect."

EasyEffects *is* the documented workaround. A reporter telling us the workaround
does nothing is not a reporter who needs to be pointed at the workaround. And
"EQ does nothing" is a real diagnostic signal, not a figure of speech: if the
loss were the enclosure's physics or the missing Windows DSP, a low-shelf boost
would still audibly change something. An EQ with *no* effect means the
attenuation happens after the signal leaves the host — inside the amp.

The reporter's own hypothesis (mismatched DSM calibration clamping the woofer
band) pointed at the right file. It was closer to the mark than they knew: the
blobs in this repo are not just mistuned for the enclosure, they are corrupted.

## Root cause: the vendored DSM blobs were transcribed wrong

`speaker-fix/src/max98390_hda_filters.c` writes 913 bytes per amp into registers
`0x2050`–`0x23E0`:

```c
#define MAX98390_DSM_START_ADDR  0x2050
#define MAX98390_DSM_PARAM_SIZE  913

for (i = 0; i < MAX98390_DSM_PARAM_SIZE; i++)
        regmap_write(priv->regmap, MAX98390_DSM_START_ADDR + i, firmware[i]);
```

Upstream ([thesofproject/linux#5616](https://github.com/thesofproject/linux/pull/5616),
`sound/hda/codecs/side-codecs/max98390_hda_filters.c` @ `bfa17b7`) has both
arrays at exactly 913 bytes, one 16-byte row per line, each row carrying a
trailing `// 0xNNNN` address comment.

When they were copied into this repo the address comments were stripped — and
with them, the only thing that made a misaligned row visible. Byte-diffing our
copy against upstream:

| Blob | Ours | Upstream | Defect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| woofer | **929** bytes | 913 | one extra all-zero 16-byte row **inserted** at index 816 (`0x2380`) |
| tweeter | **833** bytes | 913 | five 16-byte rows (80 bytes) **deleted** at index 736 (`0x2330`) |

Verified: `ours_woofer[:816] == upstream[:816]`, `ours_woofer[832:] == upstream[816:]`,
`ours_tweeter[:736] == upstream[:736]`, `ours_tweeter[736:] == upstream[816:]`.

Consequences, both silent — the loop has a fixed trip count and never looked at
the array size:

**Woofer.** Registers `0x2380`–`0x238F` get written as zeros. Everything from
`0x2390` to `0x23E0` receives the value upstream intended for the register 16
*lower*. The real values for `0x23D1`–`0x23E0` — including `0x23E0 DSMIG_EN =
0x21` — are in the array but past index 912, so they are never written at all.
`0x2380`+ is where the DSM excursion/limiter parameters live, which is exactly
the band the reporter says is missing.

**Tweeter.** From `0x2330` on, every register receives the value belonging 80
registers *higher*. Worse, the loop runs 913 iterations over an 833-byte array:
**80 bytes of out-of-bounds read** in kernel space, and whatever `.rodata`
follows gets written into registers `0x2381`–`0x23E0`. That is a KASAN splat
waiting to happen independently of any audio symptom.

The asymmetry matches the report: the woofer's mangled region is the excursion
limiter that gates low-frequency output, while a tweeter reproducing highs is
far less sensitive to a wrong limiter, so it still "works".

## The fix

- Both arrays restored to upstream's exact 913 bytes, byte-for-byte verified
  against `bfa17b7`.
- Per-row `/* 0xNNNN */` address comments restored (kernel comment style to
  match the rest of the file). These are what makes a shifted row visible on
  sight; losing them is how this got in.
- `static_assert(ARRAY_SIZE(blob) == MAX98390_DSM_PARAM_SIZE)` on both arrays,
  so a wrong-length blob is a build failure instead of an OOB read.

Verified by building the DKMS module against kernel 7.0.0-30-generic: clean
build; both upstream blobs appear verbatim in the compiled `.rodata`; deleting a
single byte from a blob fails the build on the new `static_assert`.

No DKMS version bump needed — `speaker-fix/install.sh:120` already does
`dkms remove --all` before re-adding, so an existing 1.0 install picks up the
corrected source on reinstall.

## Still true after the fix

The DSM blobs remain Google Redrix Chromebook tuning on Samsung enclosures, and
the README's "thinner than Windows" framing still applies once the woofers are
actually reproducing bass again. What changed is that "thin" no longer covers
"the woofers are dead". The README now says so, and Troubleshooting has an entry
for the silent-woofer case.

The reporter's Windows-side find (`lnl_dsm_lib.bin` et al. under
`intcoed_oemlibpath.inf_amd64_*`) is genuinely useful but is, as they say
themselves, compiled Intel SST DSP code (`$AE1` / `$CPD` headers), not a
MAX98390 register blob. Not actionable here; worth keeping on file.

## Open, not addressed here

- Whether the corrected blobs fully restore bass on Book5 Lunar Lake, or only
  partly — needs the reporter to confirm. Redrix tuning on a different
  enclosure may still under-drive the woofers even when correctly aligned.
- `max98390_configure_high_pass_filter()` takes a `cutoff_freq` argument
  (`3000`) that the function body never references — the cutoff is whatever the
  blob bakes in. Pre-existing, inherited from upstream, left alone.

expanded from the draft below with the reinstall commands, the
`grep '/* 0x2380 */' /usr/src/max98390-hda-1.0/src/max98390_hda_filters.c`
check that tells the reporter whether they actually picked up the corrected
source, and a three-way ask (bass back / better but weak / no change) so the
answer distinguishes "corruption was the whole story" from "Redrix tuning is
also a poor match for the enclosure".

**Recommendation: keep #93 open** until the reporter confirms. It found a real
bug; closing it as expected behaviour would have buried both the misalignment
and the out-of-bounds read.

# Round 2 — the blob fix changed nothing

[@Elias02345 confirmed](https://github.com/Andycodeman/samsung-galaxy-book-linux-fixes/issues/93#issuecomment-5414289413)
scenario 3: reinstalled from `1194a83`, verified the corrected source was in
`/usr/src` before rebooting, verified the module was rebuilt and loaded, and the
woofers are still silent. Probe log identical to the original report — all four
amps enumerate, no I2C/regmap errors.

So the round 1 conclusion was wrong. What round 1 actually fixed is still worth
having — an 80-byte out-of-bounds read in kernel space is a bug regardless of
whether it was audible — but it was not the cause, and the triage record above
overstates the case. Corrected in the README too: the Troubleshooting entry no
longer claims the corruption *caused* the silent woofers.

## The wording that shifted

Original report: "Woofers produce **no audible bass whatsoever** ... consistent
with only the tweeter band being reproduced."

Update: "Woofers are still **silent**, tweeters still carry the whole signal."

Those are different claims and they point at different mechanisms. "No bass but
still reproducing mids" is a filter or limiter problem. "Silent" is an amp that
isn't producing output at all. We have been reasoning from the first and the
reporter may be describing the second — this needs to be pinned down before any
more code changes.

## What actually differs between the working pair and the silent pair

Between the tweeters (`0x3c`/`0x3d`, working) and the woofers (`0x38`/`0x39`,
silent), our driver does exactly two things differently:

1. loads a different DSM blob
2. writes `0x23BA` = `0xA0` (woofer) vs `0x8d` (tweeter)

`0x2021` (PCM channel select) is 0/1 within *each* pair identically, so it does
not separate them. Everything in `max98390_hda_init()` is identical for all four.

That is the entire differential. And round 1 replaced the blob *content* without
changing the symptom.

## Leading hypothesis: the blob assignment is inverted on this board

Diffing the two corrected blobs against each other, they differ in 246
registers, almost all of them in `0x2101`–`0x228F` in 3-byte groups on a 4-byte
stride — 24-bit DSM filter coefficients. The blob *is* the crossover: the
"tweeter" blob high-passes, the "woofer" blob runs full-range.

If the physical woofers on the NP960QHA are wired to `0x3c`/`0x3d` and the
tweeters to `0x38`/`0x39` — the opposite of the Redrix/Book4 layout this code
assumes — then the physical woofers get the high-pass blob and the physical
tweeters get the full-range blob. Symptom: woofers produce no low end, tweeters
carry the whole signal. **Exactly what the reporter describes**, and completely
unaffected by correcting the blob *contents*, which is why round 1 was a null
result.

The address→speaker map in `max98390_configure_filters()` is hardcoded and has
never been verified on anything but the boards it was written for.

## Round 2 reply — POSTED

[comment-5418945969](https://github.com/Andycodeman/samsung-galaxy-book-linux-fixes/issues/93#issuecomment-5418945969),
posted 2026-08-25. Carries the wording ambiguity, the inverted-map hypothesis,
and the three tests below verbatim.

## The measurement that settles it

`i2ctransfer` (i2c-tools, already an Arch prerequisite) can talk to the amps
directly with 16-bit register addressing, without touching the driver.

**A. Did the writes land, and which blob is in which amp?**

```bash
sudo i2cdetect -y 2        # all four should show UU (driver-bound)
for a in 0x38 0x39 0x3c 0x3d; do
  printf "%s 0x23E0=" "$a"; sudo i2ctransfer -y -f 2 w2@$a 0x23 0xe0 r1
  printf "%s 0x2101=" "$a"; sudo i2ctransfer -y -f 2 w2@$a 0x21 0x01 r1
done
```

Expected if the driver did what it thinks: `0x38`/`0x39` → `0x23E0`=`0x21`,
`0x2101`=`0xD0`; `0x3c`/`0x3d` → `0x23E0`=`0x20`, `0x2101`=`0x00`.

**B. Which physical speaker is at which address?** With a sustained bass line
playing, mute one amp at a time:

```bash
sudo i2ctransfer -y -f 2 w3@0x38 0x20 0x3a 0x80   # mute  (AMP_EN 0x203A)
sudo i2ctransfer -y -f 2 w3@0x38 0x20 0x3a 0x81   # unmute
```

**C. Fault flags** (`INT_RAW1..3` at `0x2002`–`0x2004`):

```bash
for a in 0x38 0x39 0x3c 0x3d; do
  printf "%s INT_RAW=" "$a"; sudo i2ctransfer -y -f 2 w2@$a 0x20 0x02 r3
done
```

Reading the outcome of B:

| Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| muting `0x3c`/`0x3d` kills the bass | **assignment inverted** — the physical woofers are at `0x3c`/`0x3d`. One-line fix in `max98390_configure_filters()`. |
| muting `0x38`/`0x39` changes nothing audible | those amps produce no output at all — not a filter problem. Look at boost/PVDD, `0x203D SPK_GAIN`, or wiring. |
| muting `0x38`/`0x39` thins the mids | the woofers *are* being driven, so it's the crossover or the DSM limiter — back to a tuning problem, and the Redrix mismatch is live again. |

## Registers we never write

`0x2039 AMP_DSP_CFG` and `0x203D SPK_GAIN` are below the blob's `0x2050` start
and are not in `max98390_hda_init()`, so they keep power-on defaults. This is
symmetric across all four amps so it is not the differential here, but it is a
gap worth closing at some point — mainline's ASoC driver exposes `SPK_GAIN` as a
mixer control and does not rely on the default.

## Not yet ruled out

- That this is not reporter-specific at all. The README's blanket "audio will
  sound thinner and lack bass" has been the documented expectation for every
  user of this package. If the woofers are mis-assigned or under-driven
  generally, the "known limitation" may partly *be* this bug. Would need a
  second Book4/Book5 owner to run test B to know.
- The reporter's Windows-side `lnl_dsm_lib.bin` lead. Still a compiled Intel SST
  DSP module, still not droppable in, but if test B says the woofers are driven
  and merely mistuned, it becomes the interesting thread again.
