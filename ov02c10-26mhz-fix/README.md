# OV02C10 26 MHz Clock Fix (DKMS)

**Test fix** for Samsung Galaxy Book 3/4 models where the OV02C10 camera sensor
fails to probe with:

```
ov02c10 i2c-OVTI02C1:00: error -EINVAL: external clock 26000000 is not supported
```

## What this fixes

The upstream kernel's `ov02c10` driver only accepts a 19.2 MHz external clock.
Some IPU6 boards provide 26 MHz instead. This DKMS module patches the driver to
accept both frequencies.

Based on the patch from:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-media/CAKP_te-WT+HTEyhSvQ3snEOaTp5B1OUL18JjuzO238=_fTOuXQ@mail.gmail.com/

The 26 MHz clock is a **per-board property, not a platform property** — it shows
up on both Raptor Lake and Meteor Lake IPU6. Confirmed affected models:

- Galaxy Book4 Pro **940XGK** — Raptor Lake, subsystem ID `0x144dca07`
- Galaxy Book4 Ultra **NP960XGL-XG1BR** — Meteor Lake IPU6 `8086:7d19`
- Book3/Book4 Ultra Raptor Lake variants

**It is not even model-determined.** Note the full SKU on the Book4 Ultra entry
above — a different **960XGL** board (Meteor Lake IPU6 `8086:7d19`, same model
designation) runs the stock in-tree `ov02c10` with no clock error at all, and
does **not** need this fix. Two boards of the same model on the same platform
can disagree, so treat the list above as "these were seen affected", never as
"this model is affected".

So don't decide by platform, and don't decide by model: check `dmesg` for the
error above. That is exactly what `webcam-fix-libcamera/install.sh` does — it
greps for the clock rejection and offers this fix, regardless of which IPU6
generation or model the board is.

## Requirements

- Linux kernel with in-tree `ov02c10` driver (kernel 6.8+, tested up to 7.0)
- `dkms` and kernel headers (the install script will try to install these)
- Samsung Galaxy Book with IPU6 + OV02C10 sensor rejecting the 26 MHz clock
  (Raptor Lake or Meteor Lake — confirm in `dmesg`, see above)

## Secure Boot

If Secure Boot is **enabled** (common on Ubuntu/Zorin out of the box), an
unsigned DKMS module is silently rejected by the kernel, which then loads the
distro-signed *in-tree* driver — and that one still rejects the 26 MHz clock.
The result looks like "I ran the fix and rebooted but the camera still doesn't
work". `install.sh` now detects this: it configures DKMS to sign the module
with a MOK key and queues the key for enrollment. **You must complete the blue
MOK Manager enrollment screen on the next reboot** (enter the one-time password
you set), otherwise the patched driver will never load. Alternatively, disable
Secure Boot in the BIOS.

## A note on `clk_freq`

If you see `ov02c10: unknown parameter 'clk_freq' ignored` in `dmesg`, that is
**not** the cause of the failure — this driver (and the upstream one) has no
`clk_freq` module parameter. It comes from a stale
`/etc/modprobe.d/*.conf` left over from an older community workaround.
`install.sh` automatically comments it out (with a `.bak` backup).

## Install

```bash
sudo bash install.sh
```

## Verify

After installing, check that the driver loaded without the clock error:

```bash
dmesg | grep -i ov02c10
```

You should no longer see `external clock 26000000 is not supported`.

## Uninstall

```bash
sudo bash uninstall.sh
```

This removes the DKMS module and restores the stock kernel driver.

## How it works

The only change from the stock driver is in the `ov02c10_probe()` function:

```c
// Stock driver:
if (freq != OV02C10_MCLK)  // OV02C10_MCLK = 19200000

// Patched driver:
if (freq != OV02C10_MCLK_19_2MHZ && freq != OV02C10_MCLK_26MHZ)
```

This is the exact same fix proposed in the upstream kernel mailing list patch.
