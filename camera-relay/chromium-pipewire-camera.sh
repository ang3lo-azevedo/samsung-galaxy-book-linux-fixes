#!/usr/bin/env bash
# chromium-pipewire-camera.sh — route Chromium-family browsers to the camera
# through PipeWire instead of direct V4L2.
#
# Chromium cannot see the camera relay at all. Its V4L2 enumeration
# (media/capture/video/linux/video_capture_device_factory_v4l2.cc) accepts a
# node only when it reports VIDEO_CAPTURE *and not* VIDEO_OUTPUT:
#
#     (cap.capabilities & V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_CAPTURE &&
#      !(cap.capabilities & V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_OUTPUT)) ||
#     (cap.capabilities & V4L2_CAP_DEVICE_CAPS &&
#      cap.device_caps & V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_CAPTURE &&
#      !(cap.device_caps & V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_OUTPUT))
#
# The relay node is created with exclusive_caps=0, so it advertises both and
# every branch of that condition fails. Firefox accepts dual caps and reads the
# node directly, which is why it works and Chrome silently lists no camera —
# enumerateDevices() returns zero videoinput entries, before any permission
# prompt. Same filter in Edge and in every Electron app.
#
# exclusive_caps=1 would fix it at the source, but the relay deliberately moved
# away from that (see the note above nudge_wireplumber in camera-relay): with
# exclusive_caps=1 WirePlumber classifies the node as an output at boot and the
# PipeWire path breaks instead. So we take the other route — WirePlumber already
# publishes the relay as a Video/Source, and this flag makes Chromium consume it.
#
# This flag is necessary but NOT sufficient on its own. WirePlumber probes the
# loopback at login, before the relay's monitor pins its format, and caches
# v4l2loopback's catch-all range instead. WebRTC cannot parse a range, so Chrome
# finds the camera and still offers no device — same NotFoundError, different
# cause. nudge_wireplumber in camera-relay handles that half, from ExecStartPost.
# If this script reports success and Chrome still sees nothing, check there and
# in `camera-relay doctor` before suspecting the flag.
#
# Usage: ./chromium-pipewire-camera.sh [enable|disable|status] [--force]
#
#   enable    write the flag into every Chromium-family profile found (default)
#   disable   take it back out (used by the uninstallers)
#   status    report per profile, change nothing

# ── Profile discovery ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Emits "label<TAB>directory holding Local State" for every Chromium-family
# profile that exists under $1. Absent ones are skipped without comment — most
# machines have one of these, not five.
#
# Edge is deliberately absent: it ships no enable-webrtc-pipewire-camera flag,
# so there is nothing to write. It stays blind to the relay.
# Browser config directory names, matched against three packaging roots rather
# than written out as full paths. Spelling out every combination is what left
# the previous list with native Vivaldi but not the snap, and no Opera at all:
# each new browser needed three entries and nobody adds all three.
#
# Deliberately absent:
#   Edge     — does not register the entry in edge://flags, so there is nothing
#              to write into its Local State. The underlying Chromium feature is
#              compiled in, so `microsoft-edge --enable-features=WebRtcPipeWireCamera`
#              does work — just not through this file.
#   Electron — Slack, Discord, VS Code and friends keep a Local State too, but
#              they never process about:flags, so an entry there is dead weight
#              in someone else's config file. The command-line switch does not
#              help them either: PipeWire *camera* support is not wired into
#              Electron, only the screen-share capturer. electron#45058 asked
#              for it and was closed unimplemented.
#
# The feature name is `WebRtcPipeWireCamera` — BASE_FEATURE(kWebRtcPipeWireCamera)
# in media/capture/capture_switches.cc. It is case-sensitive, and
# --enable-features silently ignores a name it does not recognise, so
# "WebRTCPipeWireCamera" looks right and does nothing.
