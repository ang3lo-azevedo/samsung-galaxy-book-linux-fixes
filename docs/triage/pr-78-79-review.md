# PRs #78 and #79 review — 2026-08-04

Both from **@4nrry**, both `CHANGES_REQUESTED` posted 2026-08-04. Independent of
each other. Neither should merge as-is; each has exactly one blocking defect.

---

## #79 — "camera-relay-monitor: refuse to stream into a format the device didn't take"

`+148/-3`, `camera-relay-monitor.c` + one new test.
Verdict: 🟡 **merge after one fix.**

The change is correct: `S_FMT` can fail *or* silently adjust what it was given
and report success, and fixed-size YUYV written into whatever it settled on is
garbage to every reader. Checking the returned struct, not just the return code,
is the right instinct. Both call sites handle the new `-1`.

### Blocking — the recovery claim is false

The PR argues the relay self-heals because the unit has `Restart=on-failure`.
It doesn't: `cmd_start_ondemand` runs the monitor inside a **process
substitution**, which discards the child's exit status.

```
$ bash -c 'while IFS= read -r l; do :; done < <(echo hi; exit 42); echo "$? / ${PIPESTATUS[*]}"'
0 / 0
```

The function's last statement is `info "On-demand relay stopped"`, so it returns
0 regardless — `camera-relay start --on-demand` always exits 0 and
`Restart=on-failure` never fires. Separately the re-open call site returns 0 on
its own account (`running = 0; break;` → `return 0`), and that is the path that
runs *after* a pipeline cycle, i.e. exactly when another app may have left the
device on a foreign format.

Merging as-is trades "streams garbage silently" for "exits and stays dead until
someone restarts it by hand."

**Same shape as a bug v0.3.56 already fixed** — clean exit 0, `Restart=on-failure`
reads it as success, systemd never retries. There is a comment about it at
`camera-relay:231`.

### Fix, verified

A sentinel line inside the substitution — fits the existing event protocol and
avoids the subshell a pipe would introduce:

```bash
done < <("$MONITOR_BIN" ... ; echo "__monitor_exit:$?")
# case __monitor_exit:*) rc="${event#__monitor_exit:}" ;;
return "$rc"
```

```
monitor exits 42 → function returns 42    monitor exits 0 → returns 0
```

### Notes

- Test hygiene good — skipped correctly with a live relay holding the loopback.
- **Their "4 passed" figure is unverified here**: reaching it means stopping the
  relay on Andy's daily driver. Only the build assertion was exercised.
- Nit passed on: the check compares pixelformat/width/height but not
  `sizeimage`. Consistent for YUYV since geometry determines it; worth a comment
  so nobody "fixes" it later.

## #78 — "webcam-fix-libcamera: actually hide the raw MC-centric camera nodes"

`+973/-62` over 7 files. Introduces a **setgid binary** (`camera-relay-gst.c`,
482 lines), a udev helper (`v4l2-io-mc.c`), a new `camera-relay` group and new
udev rules. Verdict: 🔴 **do not merge.**

The analysis behind it is excellent — tracing the failure to `73-seat-late.rules`
matching the *sticky* tag list that `TAG-=` doesn't touch, demonstrated with
`udevadm test`; reading `v4l_id.c` to establish nothing carries
`V4L2_CAP_IO_MC` into udev; and splitting udev-enumerating apps from libwebrtc's
`open()`-probing walk, which is what forces the permissions approach.

### Blocking — stack buffer overflow in the setgid binary

`camera-relay-gst.c:476`, `gst_argv[n] = NULL;` writes one pointer past
`gst_argv[MAX_ARGS]`.

```
ERROR: AddressSanitizer: stack-buffer-overflow
WRITE of size 8 ... in main camera-relay-gst.c:476
[112, 624) 'gst_argv' (line 339) <== Memory access at offset 624 overflows this variable
```

`append_color_filter` guards at `argc >= MAX_ARGS - 8`, reserving 8 slots. The
tail needs **nine** — `!`, caps, `!`, `v4l2sink`, `device=…`, `io-mode=mmap`,
`sync=false`, plus the `NULL` — and the element branch can push `argc` two past
the guard in one iteration. The `--v4l2-sink` path is one element longer than
`--fd-sink`, so only that path overflows.

Reachable from argv, which for a setgid binary is attacker-controlled. Boundary,
built `-fsanitize=address,undefined`:

```
k=13 clean   k=14 clean   k=15 *** OVERFLOW ***   k=16 rejected by guard
```

Fix verified: `MAX_ARGS - 8` → `MAX_ARGS - 9` → k=14 clean, k=15 rejected, no
overflow at any length.

### Their suite passes and misses it

`tests/test-launcher-validation.sh` is **26/26 green with the overflow present**.
The cases are well chosen but all test *input rejection*, and the suite builds
without sanitizers — so the one property that matters most for a setgid binary
is unexercised. Asked for: build under `-fsanitize=address,undefined`, and a
maximal-length `--color-filter` case on **both** sink paths.

### Non-blocking

- **Stale rules filename.** `camera-relay-gst.c:6` cites
  `90-camera-relay-mc-nodes.rules`; the shipped file is `74-…` (`install.sh:1513`),
  with `90-`/`72-` cleaned up as old names. Normally cosmetic — but the PR says
  "the `74-` prefix is load-bearing", so pointing a maintainer at the wrong
  prefix matters here.
- **`--v4l2-sink` length unbounded.** `valid_ident(v4l2_sink + 10, "")` limits
  characters, not length; `/dev/video` + 100 digits validates then truncates into
  `sink_arg[64]`. `snprintf` keeps it safe, it just fails to open.

### What was *not* verified

- The security design end to end on hardware — the launcher was read and tested
  in isolation only.
- Their own two caveats stand and were repeated back rather than waved through:
  **`install.sh`/`uninstall.sh` were never run end to end** (pieces applied by
  hand), and **Book5/IPU7 is left out** for want of hardware. The installer gap
  matters most: udev rule + new group + setgid binary is exactly where ordering
  bites, and a half-applied state could leave the raw nodes group-owned with no
  launcher able to reach them.

On reading, the two properties the file sets out to hold do hold: it assembles
the pipeline itself rather than exec'ing anything handed to it, replaces the
environment wholesale rather than filtering it, `require_prefix` rejects `..` so
the prefix check isn't defeated by traversal, and the `setresgid` rationale for
avoiding `AT_SECURE` is sound. The narrower prefix list for `--egl-vendor` than
for plugin paths is the right call.

## Round 2 — 2026-08-04

### #79 — MERGED as `a6372a8`

Both review findings fixed, and @4nrry found **two more that neither the review
nor the first fix caught** — both only surfaced by installing the binary and
running it.

1. **The review's own suggested fix was wrong.** `set -e` inside the process
   substitution aborts the subshell *before* `echo "__monitor_exit:$?"` runs, so
   the sentinel never reaches the loop. Note the trap in verifying this: with a
   **builtin** (`false`) the sentinel still appears and the claim looks false;
   it only reproduces with an **external** command, which is the real case.

   ```
   plain sentinel, external failing cmd → saw: READY          (no sentinel)
   rc=0; cmd || rc=$?; echo             → saw: __monitor_exit:42
   ```

2. **Pre-existing, and would have defeated any correct sentinel.**
   `pkill -P $$` exits 1 with no children left, and under `set -e` a command
   failing inside an EXIT trap replaces the shell's exit status. Verified:
   `1` without `|| true`, `42` with. Had been flattening every exit code in this
   script since before the PR.

Mutation-tested their suite rather than trusting the numbers — both are real
guards:

| mutation | result |
|---|---|
| revert to the naive sentinel | `✗ monitor exit status was swallowed` — 4/1, exit 1 |
| drop `\|\| true` from the pkill | `✗ the EXIT trap rewrote the exit status to 1` — 4/1, exit 1 |

Post-merge on `main`: `bash -n` clean, monitor compiles, exit-propagation 5/5,
egl-vendor-pin 18/18.

### #78 — still open, one new finding

All four items verified on `8b7dc02`:

- Overflow closed. Independent ASan sweep, 1–24 filters, **both** sink paths:
  clean. `TAIL_SLOTS` with the derivation written out is better than the bare
  constant the review suggested.
- Suite now 29/29 sanitized, and mutation-confirmed: `TAIL_SLOTS` back to 8 →
  `28 passed, 1 failed`, exit 1.
- Header comment → `74-`; `--v4l2-sink` device number length-bounded.
- Installer ordering fixed: helpers built at 1517–1534, rule written at 1540
  only under `[[ -n "$MC_HELPER_OK" && -n "$LAUNCHER_OK" ]]`. They also found the
  worse half the review missed — the build sat inside `[[ -d "$RELAY_DIR" ]]`, so
  a tree without `camera-relay/` got the rule and *never* a launcher: permanent,
  not a window.

**New finding — `uninstall.sh` has the same bug, mirror-imaged:**

```
line  31:  rm -f /usr/local/bin/camera-relay-gst      ← launcher gone
   …23 privileged commands, under set -e (line 6)…
line 121:  rm -f …/74-camera-relay-mc-nodes.rules
line 130:  udevadm trigger                            ← ownership only reverts here
```

~90 lines where the nodes still belong to `camera-relay` with nothing able to
open them — the exact dead-camera state just eliminated from the installer, in
the script someone runs to *recover* from a broken state. Fix: drop the rule and
trigger udev before removing the launcher.

Left to @4nrry rather than fixed here — three lines, but neither side has run
that script and they have the hardware to exercise it (unlike #77, where the
counter-evidence was ours to hold).

Still-open caveats, stated rather than papered over: clean-install path untested
(now safe-by-construction), `uninstall.sh` unrun, Book5/IPU7 out of scope. Plus
`enable-persistent` not regenerating on reinstall — worth its own issue.
